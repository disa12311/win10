### Instructions for setting up Docker in **Codespace**

1. **Check available storage**
In the terminal, run the following command to view the partitions and available storage:

```bash
df -h
```

Choose the partition with the largest storage capacity.

2. **Create the Docker folder**
Run the following command to create the folder where Docker will store the data:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /tmp/docker-data
```

3. **Configure Docker**
Now, edit the Docker configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

Paste the following content:

```json
{
"data-root": "/tmp/docker-data"
}
```

4. **Restart your Codespace**
Power cycle your Codespace to apply the changes.

5. **Verify the configuration**
To ensure Docker is configured correctly, run:

```bash
docker info
```

2. **Start the container** with:

```bash
docker start windows
```

---

That's it! With these steps, you've successfully configured Docker and created the **Windows 10** container in your Codespace. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, don't hesitate to ask.

This file now reflects the changes we made to the `docker-compose.yml` file, such as managing credentials through the `.env` file and removing unnecessary ports and configurations. Also, remember to keep your sensitive environment variables safe and out of version control.
